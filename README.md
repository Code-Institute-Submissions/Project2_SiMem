# SiMem

SiMem is a take on the traditional Simon Says game reassembled into my own original style with a modern feature added to it. SiMem is an easy to use game primarily targeted towards a general demographic of anyone looking to play a game and improve  their memory skills while having fun.
With SiMem's Night Mode it allows for a more modern approach to app design allowing the user to safely play the game at night. We all like to go on our phones at night but it's also important to minimise eye strain where possible. 
The skill to entry level is quite low on this game making it suitable for people of all ages.

# UX

## How To Play
When starting to play any game the first question that comes to mind is "How do I play this?". In big font a "How To Play" button has been added to the screen that a user can click on to prompt a pop up. 
The pop up is from an alert() added to the button. It outlines clearly the steps to start the game, how to play the game, what to do if you mess up, winning criteria and a good luck message to finish off.
This ensures that nobody can arrive to the page and not know how to proceed with playing the game.   

## Clicks To Play
As SiMem is for anyone the one aspect of the app that effects everyone is how many clicks it takes to begin the game. SiMem has been specifically designed to be playable in 2 clicks, 4 if one decides to select the "How To Play" button. 
All clicks are also on the one page meaning once the page has been initially loaded there are no more pages to load thereafter. From personal experience having to sive through pages just to play the game each time can be extremely off putting over multiple plays. 

## User Ambitions
The user group for SiMem is anyone with basic computer skills simply look to play a game trying to: 

* Get a small win in their day
* Play something easy and fun
* Be somewhat mentally stimulated
* relax and unwind

These ambitions are achieved through SiMems: 

* Having an easy to use gaming experience
* Encouraging messages in the How To Play pop up and Win! message when one completes the game
* Having a night mode feature to reduce harsh lighting and flashes throughout the gameplay
* Minimalistic approach via as few buttons as possible with only one page to play the game compared to other apps nowadays.

## User Stories

As a general user who plays games on the internet, I want to:

 * See my progress as I play through the game.
 * Have quick access to the rules of the game displayed in a simple form.
 * Be shown when I beat the game and have the option to play again.
 * Start playing the game in as few clicks as possible.
 * Play the game with a simplistic layout so I can focus on the game.
 * The option to reduce the intensity of the brightness on my screen. 

## Mockup Design

Originally SiMem was under the name of Membrane in an initial brainstorm idea. As you can see some features of the original can be seen in the final edition of the game.

# features

## Night Mode
The night mode feature has two purposes. Upon clicking the Night Mode button it turns the blue sky background, light blue banner and yellow image all into the night sky with the opacity decreased on the game options section to reduce intensity of flashes. 

It serves both the purpose of:

 * Changing the mood from bright and entertaining to calm and relaxing depending on the environment and feelings of the user.
 * Reduce intensity of screen brightness through the opacity and using the dark black background of the night sky. 

## Level Counter display
Next to the Night Mode button we have the level counter display. When the user powers up the game it starts with the display set to 1 to show that the user is on the first level. 

As you the user progresses through the game the counter will go up by 1 to reflect each level the user is on. Once the user passes the 6th level they will have completed the game where the Level Display Counter will convey "Win!". This lets the user know they have successfully completed the game. 

If the user gets something incorrect the Display will convey "No!" to show that they did not match what the computer selected. 

## Power 
Once the user has selected the power button this will prompt the computer to begin the game. The game is completely unresponsive until the Power button is selected. 

## How To Play
The "How To Play" button pops up a display showing the user the rules of the game, winning criteria and what to do if an incorrect option is selected. 

## options
In each level the computer will highlight a set number
