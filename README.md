# SiMem

SiMem is a take on the traditional Simon Says game reassembled into my own original style with a modern feature added to it. SiMem is an easy to use game primarily targeted towards a general demographic of anyone looking to play a game and improve  their memory skills while having fun.
With SiMem's Night Mode it allows for a more modern approach to app design allowing the user to safely play the game at night. We all like to go on our phones at night but it's also important to minimise eye strain where possible. 
The skill to entry level is quite low on this game making it suitable for people of all ages.

# UX

## How To Play
When starting to play any game the first question that comes to mind is "How do I play this?". In big font a "How To Play" button has been added to the screen that a user can click on to prompt a pop up. 
The pop up is from an alert() added to the button. It outlines clearly the steps to start the game, how to play the game, what to do if you mess up, winning criteria and a good luck message to finish off.
This ensures that nobody can arrive to the page and not know how to proceed with playing the game.   

## Clicks To Play
As SiMem is for anyone the one aspect of the app that effects everyone is how many clicks it takes to begin the game. SiMem has been specifically designed to be playable in 2 clicks, 4 if one decides to select the "How To Play" button. 
All clicks are also on the one page meaning once the page has been initially loaded there are no more pages to load thereafter. From personal experience having to sive through pages just to play the game each time can be extremely off putting over multiple plays. 

## User Ambitions
The user group for SiMem is anyone with basic computer skills simply look to play a game trying to: 

* Get a small win in their day
* Play something easy and fun
* Be somewhat mentally stimulated
* relax and unwind

These ambitions are acheived through SiMems: 

* Having an easy to use gaming experience
* Encouraging messages in the How To Play pop up and Win! message when one completes the game
* Having a night mode feature to reduce harsh lighting and flashes throughout the gameplay
* Minimalistic approach via as few buttons as possible with only one page to play the game compared to other apps nowadays.




## Night Mode
The night mode feature has two purposes. Upon clicking the "Night Mode" button it turns the blue sky background, light blue banner and yellow image all into the night sky with the opacity decreased. 

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process,

focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and 
 
 how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
